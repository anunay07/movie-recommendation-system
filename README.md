A Movie Recommendation System using AWS (EC2, S3) and Streamlit

With thousands of movies released every year, users often struggle to find movies that match their taste. Traditional search methods are time-consuming and often lead to decision fatigue
A Movie Recommendation System simplifies this process by analyzing user input and suggesting movies based on content similarities, enhancing the user experience by reducing search time and improving satisfaction.

The Movie Recommendation System is built using a cloud-based architecture with AWS services and machine learning techniques. It follows a client-server model where the recommendation engine is deployed on AWS EC2, and the model and data files are stored in AWS S3.
